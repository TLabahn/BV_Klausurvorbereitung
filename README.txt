This repository contains personal study code and experiments for exam preparation in the topics of **image processing** and **neural networks** using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and Keras.

The goal is to deepen practical understanding of the material through small, self-contained examples and to document the learning process.

## Topics Covered

- Image processing fundamentals with OpenCV and NumPy
- Bit depth and greyscale value transformations
- Basic image operations (scaling, histogram analysis, etc.)
- Foundations of neural networks using Keras
- Classification tasks and training examples
- Visualization and debugging of model performance

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Recommended: virtual environment
- Required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib tensorflow
